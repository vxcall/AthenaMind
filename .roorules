roocode must be following the rules mentioned in this file.

/docs directory is supposed to be the accumulated document for AI about entire architecture and specifications.
When you drastically change architecture or specifications, write it down to markdown in /docs. either creating files or not is up to you. 
I recomment writing general architecture in a file and smaller specification into files that has names of them.

By reading docs u can grasp them.
